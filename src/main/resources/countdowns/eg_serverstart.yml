# This is an example of using the countdown to prevent players
# from entering the server when the server is just started
# Because the server is probably still loading at this time, and it is very stuck.
# 30s later, the server will be ready to accept players.
# Here we assume that a notification message is sent to the community.
# If you have a similar plugin, you can try this.
